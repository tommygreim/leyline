/**
 * Role of a card in the Prepared mechanic — None, Source, or Copy.
 *
 * ## Why a sealed Role hierarchy and not 4 nullable fields
 *
 * The first wiring iteration spread Prepared state across four optional
 * fields on `CardSnapshot`: `isPrepared`, `preparedCopyForgeCardId`,
 * `preparedSourceForgeCardId`, `isPreparedCopy`. Consumers had to mentally
 * AND them to figure out what was true: `isPrepared && copyId != null && !isPreparedCopy`
 * meant Source-with-live-copy. That pattern smelled — the four fields had
 * structural relationships (a Source has a non-null copyId, a Copy has at
 * most a sourceId, None has neither) that a sealed type can express directly.
 *
 * Replacing them with `PreparedRole = None | Source | Copy` collapses the
 * conjunctions into a `when` over the type, makes invalid combinations
 * unrepresentable, and keeps the partner's [ForgeCardId] inline so consumers
 * never need to re-read Forge state to recover the linkage.
 *
 * ## Generalization
 *
 * Card-state designations follow this shape — Saddled, Plotted, Day/Night,
 * Door states, and Commander all have a "card has state X" question with
 * structural variants (e.g. Saddled-by-whom). When implementing the next
 * one, prefer a sealed Role hierarchy over a bag of booleans on
 * `CardSnapshot`.
